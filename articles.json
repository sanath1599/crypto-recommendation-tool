    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) prices are experiencing downward pressure due to diminishing user activity and stiff upward resistance, with bears focused on the $0.80 price level.

    "fullContent": "Memecoins underperform the wider crypto market after double-digit daily losses surpass the sell-off in BTC and ETH.\n\nMemecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF) were among the worst-performing cryptocurrencies on Dec. 10, wiping out a significant part of the gains made during the Donald Trump-fueled rally a few weeks ago.\n\nThe latest drop in memecoin prices has seen the total market capitalization of the sector shrink to reach a three-week low of $119.6 billion as of Dec. 10.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees most liquidations since 2021 as ‘crazy’ reset wipes $1.6B\n\nThe last time the memecoin market cap was below $120 billion was on Nov. 27 when it rested at $118 billion. The aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies in this sector is down 21% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMemecoin market capitalization and daily trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations.

    "summary": "Memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) underperformed the broader crypto market, experiencing double-digit daily losses and wiping out significant gains made during a recent rally. The total market capitalization of memecoins has dropped to a three-week low of $119.6 billion, with some memecoin prices dropping by as much as 10.4% in the past 24 hours. This decrease is attributed to bearish momentum, with leverage traders closing more contracts and triggering significant liquidations across the crypto market."

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) token is down 5.5% on Dec. 10, amid significant corrections across the crypto market and a bearish divergence from its Relative Strength Index (RSI). The decline in SOL price follows a broader sell-off in top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, and others, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin's failure to hold above $100,000. This correction suggests that the recent rise in SOL price may be over."

Known for his career as an actor, boxer and singer, Rozik told Cointelegraph that his entry into crypto was spurred by fan encouragement.\n\nCointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra with social media influencer Abdu Rozik.

Why not? Let’s do this.”\n\nRozik is known for his rivalry with fellow social media influencer Hasbulla Magomedov.

Most recently, viral influencer Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) memecoin briefly pumped and then dumped 90%, attracting backlash from crypto community members.\n\nRozik said the answer lies in being a “nice person.” The celebrity said that people will respect you if you are a good person everywhere you go. But if you do the opposite, “no one will love you.” He added:\n\nThe 21-year-old influencer, who has spent just a month learning about crypto, highlighted his ability to pick up skills quickly. “I start now, but I learned so many things because I learned English in one year.

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

    "fullContent": "Crypto commentators say there is “not much alpha in chasing alts” right now, but are eyeing the possibility of Bitcoin retesting $99,000.\n\nThe majority of altcoins may continue to see a downtrend potentially until the end of January 2025, says Felix Hartmann, founder of venture capital firm Hartmann Capital.\n\n“Some alts may continue running briefly, but the majority are likely to slow bleed or consolidate for 2–6 weeks,” Hartmann said in a Dec. 10 X post. “Not much alpha in chasing alts here, [in my opinion], as many just topped after 2–3x moves in a week.”\n\n“While I expected slightly lower levels on some alts, perfect is the enemy of good; hence, it seems like an okay time to bring long bias back,” Hartmann said.\n\nThe overall altcoin market has seen another 24-hour tumble, with around $481.62 million in long positions liquidated over the last day, according to CoinGlass.\n\nPseudonymous trader “Mister Crypto,” said in a Dec. 10 X post that “this was the final shakeout before the real exponential breakouts.”\n\nAmong the top 100 cryptocurrencies, the biggest losers were Ethena (ENA), down 10.46%, Pepe (PEPE), which dropped 10.62%, and Bonk (BONK), falling 8.59%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading at $96,663, down 1.5% over the last day at the time of publication, and has traded below the psychologically crucial $100,000 level since Dec. 9 after reaching the six-figure milestone for the first time on Dec. 5.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $96,270 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings has reached an industry-record hashrate and bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, with Eric Trump predicting that Bitcoin will hit $1 million in the future."

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Raydium has surpassed Uniswap as the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain, with monthly volumes increasing by 30% in November. The success is attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem and the growing popularity of memecoins, which account for a significant portion of Raydium's volume. This shift may signal growth and adoption of Solana as a hub for DeFi activities."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "A Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager advises crypto traders to focus on gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems rather than individual games, as single-player game tokens are more likely to be forgotten. This approach is seen as a way to avoid the pitfalls of blind investment in individual tokens and instead invest in platforms with strong market caps and new content. The expert also praises gamers who create entertaining and educational content around gaming, citing examples like Alliestrasza, who has built a large online following by making game-related content."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours.

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations.

Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The ME token of Magic Eden, a newly launched NFT platform, plummeted to 67% below its post-launch high due to user complaints about a buggy mobile app and overly complex claiming process. The price has since rebounded sharply, trading for over $8.60 at publication time. This event may impact cryptocurrency markets as it highlights issues with new project launches and user adoption."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin miner, reached an industry-record hashrate and bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which may increase adoption of cryptocurrencies in the coming years."

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Solana-native Raydium has surpassed Uniswap as the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) in terms of monthly volumes, driven by its dominance within the Solana ecosystem and a surge in memecoins trading, which now account for over 65% of Raydium's monthly volume."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Key points impacting cryptocurrency markets include a prediction by Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora that gamers should focus on ecosystem players rather than individual games, suggesting that tokens tied to larger gaming ecosystems like Ronin Network and Immutable Games may have a higher chance of success. Additionally, popular Web3 gaming commentator Alliestrasza suggests that gamers are becoming more savvy and looking for tokenomics and project quality over hype, while gaming coach Muka emphasizes the importance of organic process and player expertise in game development."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

    "fullContent": "Memecoins underperform the wider crypto market after double-digit daily losses surpass the sell-off in BTC and ETH.\n\nMemecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF) were among the worst-performing cryptocurrencies on Dec. 10, wiping out a significant part of the gains made during the Donald Trump-fueled rally a few weeks ago.\n\nThe latest drop in memecoin prices has seen the total market capitalization of the sector shrink to reach a three-week low of $119.6 billion as of Dec. 10.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees most liquidations since 2021 as ‘crazy’ reset wipes $1.6B\n\nThe last time the memecoin market cap was below $120 billion was on Nov. 27 when it rested at $118 billion.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",
    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) price has dropped 5.5% due to a bearish trend, with other top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP also experiencing significant losses. The decline is attributed to an overheated market, Bitcoin's failure to hold above $100,000, and suppressed network activity on the Solana blockchain. A further decline in SOL price could lead to a 16% drop from its current price if it closes below $210."

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The value of Magic Eden's ME token plummeted by 67% after its launch due to complaints about a buggy mobile app and overly complex claiming process, but has since rebounded. The price drop led to user frustration and concerns about the platform's ability to manage large-scale token distribution. The token's total market capitalization remains at $776 million."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings, a Bitcoin mining company, has reached an industry-record hashrate and purchased $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, signaling potential growth in cryptocurrency markets."

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Decentralized exchange Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volumes on Solana, with memecoins driving a significant portion of its volume. This could indicate that Solana is emerging as a hub for crypto trading, particularly for memecoins, and may attract more users seeking fast and cost-effective DeFi experiences. The success of Raydium also highlights the importance of Solana's technical advantages in attracting investors and users to the platform."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Crypto experts advise investors to focus on ecosystem-level gaming tokens with strong narratives and liquidity, rather than individual games, as the market becomes increasingly competitive. This trend is exemplified by platforms like Ronin Network and Immutable Games, which have sustained higher market caps due to their ability to create original content. Investors who pick blindly without understanding tokenomics may face losses, while those who take a more informed approach are likely to succeed."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart.

This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours.

Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Raydium, a Solana-native decentralized exchange (DEX), has surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volumes for the second consecutive month, with memecoins accounting for 65% of Raydium's November volume. This success is attributed to Solana's dominance and its emerging role as a hub for memecoin trading through platforms like Pump.fun. The growth of Solana's TVL has increased by approximately five times in 2024, driven by technical advantages such as high throughput and low transaction costs."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) is experiencing decreasing user activity and stiff resistance at $1.05, driving its price lower by 9% over the last 24 hours. The attempted hack of the Cardano Foundation's X account has also negatively impacted sentiment, leading to a sharp decline in total value locked (TVL) on the network.

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun.

Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The newly launched ME token of Magic Eden dropped in value by 67% due to complaints about its buggy mobile app and complex claiming process, but has since rebounded. The airdrop was marred by technical issues, including intermittent downtime on the claims website, which caused frustration among users. Despite this, the ME token's market capitalization remains significant at $776 million."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours.

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart.

More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins. DOGE dropped 12% on the same day, while memecoins lost $1 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",
    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) price is down 5.5% amid significant corrections in the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and top tokens like XRP and ETH, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin's failure to hold above $100,000. This decline follows a bearish divergence from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating weakness in the prevailing uptrend. SOL's drop is also linked to reduced network activity, lower fees, and decreased trading volume."

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The newly launched Magic Eden token (ME) has experienced significant price fluctuations due to user complaints about a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process. The token's value dropped by as much as 67% after its launch, but has since rebounded sharply to trade above $8.60. This event may impact the broader cryptocurrency market as investors assess the platform's stability and user experience."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart.

This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency.

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems are more likely to succeed and sustain higher market caps compared to individual games.

    "fullContent": "Diminishing user activity and stiff upward resistance are driving Cardano’s prices lower today with bears focused on ADA price at $0.80.\n\nCardano (ADA) is showing weakness today, trading at $1.022, down 9% over the last 24 hours. An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) is experiencing declining user activity and stiff upward resistance, driving its price lower. The recent hacking attempt by the Cardano Foundation's X account has negatively impacted market sentiment, contributing to a decline in total value locked (TVL).

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins.

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The newly launched Magic Eden token (ME) saw its price plummet to 67% below its post-launch high due to user complaints about a buggy mobile app, complex claiming process, and intermittent downtime of the claims website, but has since rebounded to trade for over $8.60."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Crypto commentators predict a potential short-term uptrend for Bitcoin, with some analysts suggesting it could retest $99,000 driven by short squeezes. Meanwhile, the majority of altcoins are expected to see continued downward pressure until the end of January 2025, according to Felix Hartmann.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc., a leading Bitcoin miner, has purchased $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate of 50 EH/s, while New York has approved Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin.

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems are expected to perform better than individual game tokens, according to Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora. This is due to the fact that ecosystem players have a higher market cap ($3.48 billion for Immutable IMX vs $848.38 million for Ronin RON) and can sustain their value through new content additions. Additionally, experts suggest that gamers who create engaging content around web3 games will benefit from increased rewards and views."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

The aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies in this sector is down 21% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMemecoin market capitalization and daily trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins. DOGE dropped 12% on the same day, while memecoins lost $1 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) token price has dropped 5.5% on Dec. 10, following a broader crypto market correction, with other top-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), BNB, XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) also experiencing significant losses. The decline is driven by an overheated market and Bitcoin's failure to hold above $100,000, as well as suppressed network activity on the Solana blockchain. A bearish divergence in SOL's price and relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the correction may not be over."

    "fullContent": "Abdu Rozik told Cointelegraph at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi that celebrities should have good intentions when entering crypto.\n\nWhile celebrity-launched memecoins often cause controversy, social media influencer and singer Abdurozik Savriqul Muhammadroziqi, known as “Abdu Rozik,” said the solution is simple: Be a good person.\n\nSpeaking at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Rozik shared his plans to explore the crypto and blockchain space. Known for his career as an actor, boxer and singer, Rozik told Cointelegraph that his entry into crypto was spurred by fan encouragement.\n\nCointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra with social media influencer Abdu Rozik. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe social influencer, who has over eight million followers on Instagram, said his fans are urging him to explore digital assets. “My fans keep messaging me, saying I should try crypto,” Rozik said. “I’ve decided to give it a shot because they’ll support me. Why not? Let’s do this.”\n\nRozik is known for his rivalry with fellow social media influencer Hasbulla Magomedov. Magomedov challenged the singer to a mixed martial arts fight, but it did not occur after the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association (RDAA) deemed it unethical.\n\nAbdu Rozik engaging with the crypto community at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nDespite just entering the space, Rozik emphasized the importance of good intentions when engaging with the crypto community.\n\nMany celebrity-backed crypto projects have already gone south. Most recently, viral influencer Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) memecoin briefly pumped and then dumped 90%, attracting backlash from crypto community members.\n\nRozik said the answer lies in being a “nice person.” The celebrity said that people will respect you if you are a good person everywhere you go. But if you do the opposite, “no one will love you.” He added:\n\nThe 21-year-old influencer, who has spent just a month learning about crypto, highlighted his ability to pick up skills quickly. “I start now, but I learned so many things because I learned English in one year. My mind is very fast. I can take things very fast,” he said.\n\nAbdu Rozik listening to the panel discussions at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi.

    "summary": "Crypto influencer Abdu Rozik, who recently entered the space with 8 million followers, emphasized the importance of having good intentions when engaging with the crypto community, suggesting that being a 'nice person' can lead to respect and trust from others. This message may impact the perception of celebrity-backed tokens, which have often been met with skepticism in the past. Rozik's comments also resonate with Changpeng Zhao's previous call for focusing on practical blockchain applications rather than memecoins."

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc. set an industry record by buying $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reaching a hashrate of over 50 exahashes per second, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin was approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which may lead to increased adoption and stability in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin will hit $1 million in the future, further boosting investor confidence."

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely.

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano's (ADA) price is under pressure due to decreasing user activity and strong bearish sentiment, with bears focused on the $0.80 support level.

Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins. DOGE dropped 12% on the same day, while memecoins lost $1 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings has reached an industry-record hashrate of 50 EH/s and bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, with predictions that Bitcoin will hit $1 million in the future."

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming token investors are advised to focus on ecosystem-level tokens rather than individual game tokens, as they are more likely to sustain high market caps. The increasing popularity of AI memecoin and the rise of narrative-driven gaming could lead to a surge in interest and investment in the space. Meanwhile, experienced gamers and coaches believe that the key to success lies in creating engaging content and strategies, rather than simply competing in tournaments."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart.

The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Why not? Let’s do this.”\n\nRozik is known for his rivalry with fellow social media influencer Hasbulla Magomedov. Magomedov challenged the singer to a mixed martial arts fight, but it did not occur after the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association (RDAA) deemed it unethical.\n\nAbdu Rozik engaging with the crypto community at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nDespite just entering the space, Rozik emphasized the importance of good intentions when engaging with the crypto community.\n\nMany celebrity-backed crypto projects have already gone south. Most recently, viral influencer Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) memecoin briefly pumped and then dumped 90%, attracting backlash from crypto community members.\n\nRozik said the answer lies in being a “nice person.” The celebrity said that people will respect you if you are a good person everywhere you go. But if you do the opposite, “no one will love you.” He added:\n\nThe 21-year-old influencer, who has spent just a month learning about crypto, highlighted his ability to pick up skills quickly. “I start now, but I learned so many things because I learned English in one year. My mind is very fast. I can take things very fast,” he said.\n\nAbdu Rozik listening to the panel discussions at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi.

Execs weigh in\n\nCrypto proponents like former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao have urged the community to focus on practical blockchain applications instead of memecoins. On Nov. 26, Zhao encouraged the community to build real applications, saying memes have become weird.\n\nChangpeng Zhao at the Bitcoin MENA stage in Abu Dhabi.

He said that while people still view Bitcoin (BTC) as an investment asset, he believes that in the next decade or so, the space “will see more utility.”\n\nMagazine: Simp DAO queen Irene Zhao on why good memes are harder than trading: X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Celebrity influencer Abdu Rozik emphasizes the importance of having good intentions and being a 'nice person' when entering the crypto space, suggesting that this is key to gaining respect from the community. This comes as some experts warn against celebrity-backed memecoins and encourage focus on practical blockchain applications. The trend could potentially impact cryptocurrency markets by shifting attention towards more utility-focused projects."

RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc., a leading Bitcoin miner, has reached an industry record by buying $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and exceeding 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) hashrate. Additionally, Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, while Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin will hit $1 million due to its adoption by governments and institutions."

Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) price is experiencing weakness due to diminished user activity and stiff upward resistance, with bears focused on the $0.80 price level. The recent hacking incident of the Cardano Foundation's X account further eroded investor sentiment, leading to a decline in total value locked (TVL) on the network. ADA faces strong resistance at $1.05, and failure to hold above this level could push the price lower towards $0.60-$0.49."

This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) is experiencing downward pressure due to diminishing user activity, increased bearish sentiment, and the recent hacking of the Cardano Foundation's X account, which led to a decline in total value locked (TVL). The price is trading at $1.022, down 9% over the last 24 hours, with bears focused on the $0.80 support level. ADA faces strong resistance above $1.05 and may continue its downward trend if it fails to hold above $0.80."

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024.

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

The aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies in this sector is down 21% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMemecoin market capitalization and daily trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period.

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",

Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The ME token of Magic Eden, a newly launched NFT platform, experienced a sharp drop in value following its airdrop due to technical issues with its mobile app and claiming process, which led to widespread complaints from users."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely.

    "summary": "Gaming token investors are advised to focus on ecosystem players rather than individual games, as single-player games with token launches may be more likely to be forgotten. Experts also suggest that market sentiment has shifted, with more attention and liquidity now being split across multiple tokens, making it essential to do thorough research before investing. Additionally, gaming coaches and content creators are gaining recognition for their skills, with some even enjoying lucrative rewards from game rewards systems."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect.

    "summary": "Key points impacting cryptocurrency markets include: The advice to focus on gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems rather than individual games may favor ecosystem players like Ronin Network and Immutable Games, which have higher market caps. Additionally, the rise of narrative-driven gaming and AI memecoin surges is expected to drive growth in the space, but investors should be cautious due to increased token liquidity and scams."

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc. has bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate of 50 EH/s, while Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services.

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Decentralized exchange Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volumes for the second consecutive month, with a 30% lead in November and a 10% lead in October, largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem and growing memecoin trading activity."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) prices are experiencing downward pressure due to reduced user activity and stiff upward resistance, with bears focused on the $0.80 support level. The attempted fraud and hacker incident on the Cardano Foundation's X account have also negatively impacted investor sentiment, leading to a decline in total value locked (TVL). Bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around $1.05, suggesting that ADA may face downward pressure if unable to hold above this level."

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This case highlights the importance of regulatory oversight in cryptocurrency markets and may lead to increased scrutiny of unregistered investment schemes."

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token dipped as low as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token has dipped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and an overly complex claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded sharply and is now trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as overly convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets, and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” jested pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users roughly three hours after the claim went live, saying the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives, and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The launch of Magic Eden's ME token led to a significant price drop due to user complaints about a buggy mobile app and complex claiming process.

    "fullContent": "Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings has bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate of 50 EH/s, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services.

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Decentralized exchange Raydium surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volumes for the second month in a row, with Solana's growing popularity and low transaction costs contributing to its success, particularly among memecoins that account for a significant portion of Raydium's volume."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "The article suggests that investing in gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems, rather than individual games, is a smarter bet for cryptocurrency traders. Experts like Serge-Raymond Nzabandora and Muka believe that ecosystem players with original content can sustain higher market caps and offer better returns on investment. The rise of AI memecoin surges and the growing popularity of Web3 gaming platforms are also expected to drive interest in narrative-driven games."

    "fullContent": "Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc. has reached an industry-record hashrate by buying $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and doubling its energized hashrate to 50 EH/s, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, predicting a potential increase in adoption and value for cryptocurrency."

It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Cryptocurrency experts are shifting their focus to gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems rather than individual games, citing the potential for more sustainable market caps and increased narrative appeal. Experts like Alliestrasza and Muka emphasize the importance of understanding tokenomics and finding projects with solid underlying mechanics. Meanwhile, the industry continues to mature, with new features like Perpetual Rewards and Axie Adoption Center being introduced."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart.

Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours.

Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The launch of Magic Eden's ME token was marred by a 67% price drop due to user complaints about a buggy mobile app, complicated claiming process, and intermittent website downtime.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Raydium, a Solana-native decentralized exchange (DEX), has surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volumes for the second consecutive month, with memecoins accounting for a significant portion of its volume. This success is attributed to Raydium's dominance within the Solana ecosystem and its ability to capture over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network. The growth of Solana, driven by its technical advantages, is partly due to Raydium's presence."

Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart.

This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency.

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Decentralized exchange Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second consecutive month, with a significant lead in Solana's ecosystem, driven largely by memecoins trading on the platform."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming tokens with ties to entire ecosystems are likely to be more stable and sustainable than those tied to individual games, according to Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora. This is because ecosystem players can sustain higher market caps through new content, whereas single-game tokens may fade in popularity. As a result, investors should look for tokens with strong narrative potential and a solid understanding of tokenomics."

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) prices are experiencing downward pressure due to diminishing user activity and strong upward resistance. The recent hacking incident on the Cardano Foundation's X account has also negatively impacted market sentiment, leading to a decline in total value locked (TVL) on the network. Bears have established a strong supply zone around $1.05, suggesting that ADA may face significant resistance as it attempts to recover."

PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart.

Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token fell as much as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token dropped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and a complicated claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded and was trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The launch of Magic Eden's ME token saw its price drop by up to 67% due to complaints from users about a buggy mobile app, complicated claiming process, and intermittent downtime on the claims website. The platform's self-titled token was initially priced at $6.70 and briefly rallied before plummeting. Since then, the price has rebounded, with the token now trading for over $8.60."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Bitcoin's price is currently at $96,663, down 1.5% from the previous day, and has traded below $100,000 since Dec. 9. Analysts predict a possible retest of $99,000 due to short squeezes, which could liquidate around $1.53 billion in short positions if reached.

    "fullContent": "Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\n\nToday in crypto, MARA Holdings has bought another $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin and reached an industry-record hashrate, New York has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and Eric Trump predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million as governments and institutions will adopt it\n\nBitcoin (BTC) mining heavyweight MARA Holdings Inc. bought another 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10 and — an industry first — said its hashrate exceeded 50 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMARA said it snapped up its latest haul from its zero-coupon convertible note offering from last month at a price of $96,000 per BTC. As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency. Ripple executives believe the collective stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion in the next four years, up from around $207 billion today.\n\nTrump, an American businessman, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of United States President-elect Donald Trump, predicted that Bitcoin will someday hit $1 million.\n\nTrump took the stage with a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10 to praise Bitcoin (BTC) as a “financial paradigm” and a global asset.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin one day, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential to “transform the global economy in beautiful ways.”\n\nThe businessman also predicted that more governments will embrace Bitcoin in the coming years, stressing that early adopters will be among those who win.\n\nEric Trump praised Bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi. Source: YouTube\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment,” describing it instead as a “global asset.”\n\n“It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he said.",
    "summary": "MARA Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin mining heavyweight, has reached an industry-record hashrate of 50 EH/s and bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services. Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin will hit $1 million in the future. The news may impact cryptocurrency markets with a potential increase in Bitcoin mining efficiency and growth in stablecoin adoption."

    "fullContent": "Solana-native Raydium beat Uniswap in decentralized exchange trading volumes in October and November, according to Messari.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly volumes for the second month in a row, according to a Dec. 10 Messari report.\n\nIn November, Solana native Raydium beat Uniswap — generally the most popular DEX — in monthly volumes by roughly 30%, or approximately $30 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis followed a narrower win in October, when Raydium outperformed Uniswap by approximately 10%, according to a Nov. 17 post on the X platform by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital.\n\nRaydium’s “success is largely attributed to its dominance within the Solana ecosystem,” the Messari report said, adding that the DEX consistently captures over 60% of daily DEX volume on the layer-1 blockchain network.\n\nIn particular, “[m]emecoin trading has become a substantial driver of Raydium’s volume, with memecoins accounting for an all-time high of 65% of Raydium’s monthly volume in November,” the report added.\n\nFueled by venture capital funding and political speculation, memecoins now command approximately $130 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn 2024, Solana emerged as a hub for memecoin trading, largely because of the soaring popularity of Pump.fun, a platform for minting memecoins and bootstrapping trading liquidity.\n\nMany Pump.fun memecoins eventually trade on Raydium.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, Pump.fun is the fifth-highest-earning Web3 protocol by revenue, clocking upward of $100 million in fee revenues during the past 30 days.\n\nPump.fun’s revenues rank just below those of giants such as Circle, USD Coin’s (USDC) issuer, and the Solana network.\n\nIn October, the team behind Pump.fun tipped plans for a future token release and a newly upgraded trading terminal, dubbed “Pump Advance.”\n\nRaydium solely operates on Solana, whereas Uniswap maintains an expansive presence across some 18 blockchain networks, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) has increased by approximately five times in 2024. It still greatly lags frontrunner Ethereum, which commands upward of $70 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nSolana’s “growth is partly due to [its] technical advantages, including high throughput and low transaction costs, which have attracted users seeking a faster and more cost-effective DeFi experience,” the Messari report said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Uniswap launched its own application-specific layer-2 blockchain network, Unichain.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards",
    "summary": "Raydium surpassed Uniswap as the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) in Solana ecosystem, driven by significant volumes of memecoin trading, with Raydium capturing over 60% of daily DEX volume on the network. This success is attributed to Solana's technical advantages and the growth of Pump.fun memecoins, which have become a substantial driver of Raydium's volume. The Solana ecosystem continues to gain traction in the DeFi space, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing by approximately five times in 2024."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",

An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart.

    "fullContent": "Memecoins underperform the wider crypto market after double-digit daily losses surpass the sell-off in BTC and ETH.\n\nMemecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogwifhat (WIF) were among the worst-performing cryptocurrencies on Dec. 10, wiping out a significant part of the gains made during the Donald Trump-fueled rally a few weeks ago.\n\nThe latest drop in memecoin prices has seen the total market capitalization of the sector shrink to reach a three-week low of $119.6 billion as of Dec. 10.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees most liquidations since 2021 as ‘crazy’ reset wipes $1.6B\n\nThe last time the memecoin market cap was below $120 billion was on Nov. 27 when it rested at $118 billion. The aggregate market value of cryptocurrencies in this sector is down 21% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMemecoin market capitalization and daily trading volume. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe drop in memecoins on Dec. 10 was preceded by a decrease in open interest (OI), with Pnut (PNUT) leading the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the last 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest refers to the total amount of pending derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations.

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) price has declined by 5.5% due to a bearish divergence from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and significant corrections in other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB, XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE). The Solana ecosystem's market capitalization has also dropped, leading to lower network activity and revenue. The decline is attributed to the failure of Bitcoin to hold above $100,000, which likely suppressed buying in the overall market."

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency.

In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems like Ronin Network and Immutable Games are more likely to sustain higher market caps due to new content and player ownership economies.

    "fullContent": "Diminishing user activity and stiff upward resistance are driving Cardano’s prices lower today with bears focused on ADA price at $0.80.\n\nCardano (ADA) is showing weakness today, trading at $1.022, down 9% over the last 24 hours. An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe social sentiment and reduced TVL on Cardano indicate diminished user interaction, decreasing demand for ADA tokens and negatively impacting its price.\n\nWith ADA price trading at $1.0, bears appear to have established a strong supply zone around the $1.05 price range.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that over 928,460 ADA addresses had moved roughly 102,150 ADA tokens for an average price of $1.05 between $1.03 and $1.06.\n\nCardano IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe same IOMAP chart above shows that ADA faces relatively strong resistance in its recovery path compared to the support it enjoys on the downside. This suggests that the path with the least resistance for the token is downward.\n\nThis view is shared by pseudonymous technical analyst Sssebi who says that there is not much support for ADA if it breaks below a key level at $1.05.\n\nSssebi was referring to the lower trendline of a bull flag in the four-hour timeframe, which was breached during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nADA/USD four-hour chart. Source: Sssebi\n\nIn another post, Sssebi said that the “bottom could be in for ADA,” as evidenced by the large volume candle on the daily chart.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons crypto dino coins like XRP, Tron and ADA are going parabolic\n\nA close look at the technical setup reveals that ADA is still trading above a multi-year downtrend line, broken five weeks ago. The weekly chart below shows that $0.80 is an area of strong support for the ADA price.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator continues its upward trajectory in the positive region, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the upside.\n\nADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the bulls are able to sustain the uptrend, they are likely to push ADA higher, with the $2.40 level representing the upside target for the buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to hold above $0.80 would signal the inability of the buyers to stop the sell-off, with the next logical move being the $0.60 to $0.49 demand zone, where all the major simple moving averages sit.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",
    "summary": "Cardano (ADA) prices are falling due to decreasing user activity and strong downward resistance, with sentiment turning negative amid concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend. The recent hacking attempt by a hacker promoting fraudulent claims has further reduced user interaction and demand for ADA tokens, leading to a 21% decline in total value locked (TVL). Bears have established a strong supply zone around $1.05, which could limit ADA's upside potential."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector has nearly doubled over the same period, indicating the intensity of the selling pressure over the past 24 hours.\n\nDogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization, led the losses, dropping 5.6% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s rival SHIB was down as well, recording 10.4% daily losses, while Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) was the only top-cap memecoin posting gains, up 1.7%.\n\nTop memecoins’ price performance.

In a futures contract, for every seller, a buyer is required to settle the contract.\n\nDOGE saw its IO drop by over 20% on the day to $3.1 billion, nearly six times WIF’s $519 million in OI, which had decreased by 27% over the same period. PEPE’s OI was standing at $302.4 million, down approximately 11%.\n\nMemecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe drop in OI for memecoins indicates bearish momentum in the market as leverage traders close more contracts in anticipation of further decreases in price.\n\nThe crypto market drawdown has wiped out more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions within the past 24 hours, with over $1.3 billion being wiped out over the last 12 hours alone.\n\n“The biggest long liquidation of this bull cycle so far,” CoinGlass said in a Dec. 10 post on X.\n\nFutures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recorded higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver $72.6 million in DOGE longs and more than $22.35 million in SHIB longs accounted for the majority of liquidations across memecoins in the past half-a-day.\n\nSimilarly, more than $7.9 million PEPE longs and $3.6 million WIF longs were liquidated over the same period.\n\nTotal crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins. DOGE dropped 12% on the same day, while memecoins lost $1 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "SOL price is down today as a pronounced decline in Solana-based tokens and a bearish divergence from the RSI suggest that the correction is probably not over.\n\nSolana’s native token, SOL (SOL), is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections and over $1 billion in liquidations across the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL trading 17% below its $263 all-time high reached on Nov. 24.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours.

Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance.

The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: CoinGlass\n\nThis marked the biggest liquidation event since 2021, accompanying the start of the 2022 bear market. More recently, a similar liquidation event accompanied the Dec. 5 flash crash that saw more than $816 million longs wiped out of the derivatives market against $280 million short.\n\nDuring this event, BTC price dropped as much as 11% to $92,00, triggering a sell-off in altcoins, including memecoins. DOGE dropped 12% on the same day, while memecoins lost $1 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Dogwifhat have suffered double-digit daily losses, with the total market capitalization of the sector reaching a three-week low of $119.6 billion on Dec. 10. This drop has wiped out significant gains made during the recent Donald Trump-fueled rally and is attributed to bearish momentum and increased leverage trading, resulting in $1.7 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated."

    "fullContent": "The price of Magic Eden’s freshly airdropped ME token fell as much as 67% from its post-launch high amid a flurry of complaints from users.\n\nMagic Eden’s freshly launched token dropped in value on its release as the non-fungible token (NFT) platform’s users complained of a buggy mobile app and a complicated claiming process, among other issues.\n\nThe platform’s self-titled token, Magic Eden (ME), debuted on Dec. 10 at $6.70 and briefly rallied as high as $13.10 before plummeting as much as 67% to a low of $4.30, according to DexScreener data.\n\nThe price of ME has since rebounded and was trading for just over $8.60 at the time of publication.\n\nThe price of Magic Eden’s native ME token has whipsawed following its airdrop. Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The price of Magic Eden's ME token plummeted by 67% after its airdrop due to complaints about a buggy mobile app, complicated claiming process, and intermittent downtime on the claims website. The platform's users also expressed frustration with the complexity of the process, leading to a significant sell-off. However, the token's price has since rebounded and is now trading for over $8.60."

Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The launch of Magic Eden's ME token saw a 67% price drop due to technical issues with its mobile app and confusing claims process, which led to complaints from users. The airdrop was plagued by bugs, including intermittent downtime on the claims website, and users were frustrated with the complexity of claiming their tokens. Despite the initial backlash, the price of ME has since rebounded."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely.

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect.

    "summary": "Solana's native token SOL dropped 5.5% on Dec. 10 amid significant corrections across the crypto market, with other top-cap cryptocurrencies like ETH and BNB also posting losses. The decline is attributed to an overheated market and Bitcoin's failure to hold above $100,000, leading to a bearish divergence from RSI indicators. This suggests that the correction may not be over and SOL price could potentially drop further."

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The Magic Eden ME token experienced a 67% price drop after its airdrop due to complaints about a buggy mobile app and complicated claiming process, which led to widespread user frustration. The token has since rebounded to trade over $8.60, but the incident highlights the importance of user experience in cryptocurrency platforms. This event may have implications for investor sentiment and market perception of Magic Eden."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "Crypto commentators predict a potential Bitcoin retest of $99,000 due to short squeezes, while the majority of altcoins may continue to decline until late January 2025. The altcoin market has seen significant liquidations and downtrends, with some coins experiencing 10-12% losses in a single day. These trends may signal a shorter consolidation period for Bitcoin before a new leg higher begins in Q1."

Source: DexScreener\n\nThe airdrop was marred by complaints from users, who described the process for claiming the token as convoluted and said that Magic Eden’s mobile app — needed for the claims process — was glitchy and hard to navigate.\n\n“My app is stuck, can’t claim, people dumping ME like hot cakes. Awesome,” one user wrote in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“Why make this so complicated — I simply do not understand why you would do this,” another wrote.\n\nThere was also confusion among users on whether the tokens could be claimed via desktop or solely on mobile.\n\n“Can you only claim on mobile? Or can I claim on desktop? Mobile shows unclickable ‘claim now’ and desktop only shows ‘stake now,’” a user asked on X in response to Magic Eden.\n\nTo claim ME, users were made to download Magic Eden’s mobile app, scan a QR code on a desktop device such as a laptop, link their eligible wallets and then claim their allocated airdrop.\n\nToday’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here.Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes.You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers.More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv\n\n“I would give up 50% of my $ME airdrop just to never use this f*cking mobile app again,” said pseudonymous crypto user wale.moca in a Dec. 10 post to X.\n\nThere was also a swathe of complaints that the airdrop claims website had suffered intermittent downtime — presumably due to an outsized spike in traffic as claimants rushed to grab their promised ME tokens.\n\nRelated: Magic Eden faces backlash over US service separation\n\nMagic Eden notified users about three hours after the claim went live that the issue had been resolved.\n\nThe ME token, released by the platform’s backing Magic Eden Foundation, has a total supply of 1 billion, with 125 million tokens being made available to the NFT platform’s users until Feb. 1 next year.\n\nOf the total 1 billion supply, 12.5% was allocated to the airdrop, 50% has been reserved for community incentives and the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nAt the time of publication, the ME token touts a total market capitalization of $776 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) — the token’s price multiplied by the total unreleased supply —  of $5.9 billion.\n\nMagazine: Charles Hoskinson, Cardano and Ethereum – for the record",
    "summary": "The Magic Eden ME token's price dropped 67% on its release due to complaints about a buggy mobile app and complicated claiming process. The airdrop was marred by user confusion over claiming methods, technical issues, and downtime of the claims website. Despite rebounding somewhat, this incident highlights the risks associated with new cryptocurrency releases and the importance of user experience in token adoption."

    "fullContent": "Crypto traders looking to make smarter bets on gaming tokens should go for ones tied to entire ecosystems, not just individual games, says Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora.\n\n“These single-player games with token launches, I think, are more likely to be forgotten, right? Compared to the likes of the Ronins of the world and the Immutables of the world, you want to look at ecosystem players,” he tells Web3 Gamer.\n\nRonin Network and Immutable Games are blockchain gaming platforms designed to support developers building games with player-owned economies.\n\nNzabandora says both are “able to sustain these higher market caps by having new content which is original.” Immutable (IMX) has a market cap of $3.48 billion, while Ronin (RON) stands at $848.38 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n“Whether Ronins or Axies makes a return or not, it still has Pixels, right,” he says.\n\nPixel is a laid-back adventure game that has become one of the largest Web3 games by daily active user count. In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems are likely to outperform individual game tokens, according to Yield Guild Games corporate development and finance manager Serge-Raymond Nzabandora. This is due to the growing interest in narratives and increasing market competition, which may lead to a more sustainable and rewarding experience for gamers. The success of platforms like Ronin Network and Immutable Games with high market caps suggests that ecosystem-based tokens are a key strategy for gaming token investors."

In May it crossed 1 million daily active users.\n\nNzabandora sees the AI memecoin surge as a sign of growing interest in narratives, which could lead to a “bigger push for gaming” as a narrative.\n\nHe believes the current cycle will play out differently, as the “market is a lot smarter than the previous market.” That said, funds and attention are now split across a lot of different tokens.\n\n“The amount of liquidity, the increase hasn’t been commensurate with the increase of tokens, and therefore the mindshare’s split massively right,” he says.\n\n“I think those who necessarily pick blindly, without much of a sense of the underlying tokenomics…will see red.”\n\nPopular Web3 gaming commentator and content creator Alliestrasza made the leap from traditional Web2 gaming content just over a year ago — and it still doesn’t sit right with her former colleagues.\n\n“My peers from Web2 keep thinking that I am doing something nefarious by supporting crypto and blockchain games,” she told Web3 Gamer at the recent YGG Play Summit in the Philippines.\n\n“There have been a lot of scams in the space, so their impression of it isn’t great if you don’t take the time to look at the projects that are building good stuff,” says the 31-year-old gamer from Los Angeles.\n\nAlliestrasza switched because she wanted to be rewarded for all the time and money she invested in gaming.\n\n“I have put thousands of dollars [into games] that I can never extract,” she told Game7 DAO back in April 2023 to explain making the leap.\n\nNow she’s getting rewarded for playing games, unlike her Web2 gamer friends who are basically volunteering to spruik for multibillion-dollar corporations — and she’s pulling in tons of views on her content, too.\n\nHelping Ukraine without donating: Laura’s DeFi staking plan\n\n10 crypto theories that missed as badly as ‘Peter Todd is Satoshi’\n\nAs an ambassador for the sci-fi card game Parallel, she’s built a solid online following with over 113,000 YouTube subscribers, more than 16.5 million views across her videos, and 235,000 Twitch followers, all by making entertaining and educational gaming content.\n\nAlliestrasza prefers making content to competing in gaming tournaments, even though she has competed at a high level.\n\n“I do still enjoy competing, and I did it a lot in Hearthstone, but I think that I’ve come to the realization that the thing I love most is entertaining and connecting with people,” she adds.\n\n“You get to be on camera connecting with people, and I think that’s honestly more where I shine,” she says.\n\nAlliestrasza says that commentating keeps you in the thick of the action the whole time.\n\n“Sometimes, when you compete, you can just lose right away, and you’re out completely. But if you’re the caster and the commentator, you get to sort of be there for the whole experience,” she says.\n\nGaming tournaments at conventions are way more intense than you might expect. But the weirdest part for outsiders? The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "The article highlights the importance of investing in gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems rather than individual games. Analysts and experts suggest that these ecosystem players have a higher market cap and are more likely to sustain their value due to the creation of new content and original narratives, which could lead to increased interest in gaming as a narrative."

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) token is experiencing a correction, with a 5.5% decline in price, as other top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and BNB, also posting significant losses. The drop in SOL price coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network and suppressed network activity, indicating that the correction may not be over.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nLet’s look closer at the factors driving SOL price down today.\n\nSolana corrects alongside other cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped, triggered by an overheated market and Bitcoin’s failure to hold above $100,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained relatively unchanged with 2% losses, while top tokens and midcaps recorded their worst losses in recent months following a sharp drop during the early Asian trading hours on Dec. 10.\n\nEther (ETH) has dropped more than 4.6% over the last 24 hours to trade at $3,735.\n\n24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360\n\nOther top-cap cryptocurrencies, including BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also posted significant losses over the last 24 hours. Tron (TRX) posted the largest daily losses among the top-cap cryptocurrencies, down 13.8% today.\n\nSimilarly, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 4.5% over the last 24 hours to rest at $3.46 trillion at the time of publication.\n\n“Bitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100K, likely suppressing buying in the overall market, “ FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in response to today’s corrections in the crypto market.\n\nSolana’s bearishness on Dec. 10 coincides with an ongoing correction in the prices of tokens built on its network. Most are posting significant daily losses, as shown in the figure below.\n\nSolana-based tokens performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMoreover, the overall market capitalization of all Solana-based tokens dropped from $361.8 billion on Dec. 9 to $342 billion on Dec. 10. The total trading volume increased by 137% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity.\n\nInvestors likely reacted negatively to the dropping value and market activity of tokens within the Solana ecosystem, resulting in the drop in SOL price.\n\nThis accompanies a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem, according to the data provided by Dune dashboard pump.fun. Today’s SOL price drop was preceded by a sharp drop in the number of network transactions.\n\nThe amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has nearly halved since Nov. 20.\n\nSolana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun\n\nThis indicates suppressed network activity, and less overall user interaction with the platform resulting in lower revenues from fees.\n\nAdditional data from Dune reveals a sharp reduction in Solana’s daily revenue, which currently stands at 12,361 SOL (~$2.7 million) on Dec. 9, down from a year-to-date high of 55,832 SOL (~12 million) on Nov. 23.\n\nSOL’s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI) in the daily timeframe.\n\nSOL’s price recorded a series of higher highs between April and November. But, in the same period, its daily RSI descended, forming lower highs.\n\nAs a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and a falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, which can motivate traders to sell more at local highs.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThis appears to what has happened as the rise in SOL price to all-time highs led to overbought conditions on Nov. 22 when the daily RSI hit 77, as profit-booking set in.\n\nThe bears now focus on immediate support at $210, and later, the former resistance, which was flipped to support at $200.\n\nA daily candlestick close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend. The next logical move would be to the psychological level at $180, marking a 16% decline from the current price.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",
    "summary": "The Solana (SOL) price is down 5.5% on Dec. 10 due to a bearish divergence from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating that the correction may not be over, and other top-cap cryptocurrencies are also experiencing significant losses."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "fullContent": "Crypto commentators say there is “not much alpha in chasing alts” right now, but are eyeing the possibility of Bitcoin retesting $99,000.\n\nThe majority of altcoins may continue to see a downtrend potentially until the end of January 2025, says Felix Hartmann, founder of venture capital firm Hartmann Capital.\n\n“Some alts may continue running briefly, but the majority are likely to slow bleed or consolidate for 2–6 weeks,” Hartmann said in a Dec. 10 X post. “Not much alpha in chasing alts here, [in my opinion], as many just topped after 2–3x moves in a week.”\n\n“While I expected slightly lower levels on some alts, perfect is the enemy of good; hence, it seems like an okay time to bring long bias back,” Hartmann said.\n\nThe overall altcoin market has seen another 24-hour tumble, with around $481.62 million in long positions liquidated over the last day, according to CoinGlass.\n\nPseudonymous trader “Mister Crypto,” said in a Dec. 10 X post that “this was the final shakeout before the real exponential breakouts.”\n\nAmong the top 100 cryptocurrencies, the biggest losers were Ethena (ENA), down 10.46%, Pepe (PEPE), which dropped 10.62%, and Bonk (BONK), falling 8.59%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading at $96,663, down 1.5% over the last day at the time of publication, and has traded below the psychologically crucial $100,000 level since Dec. 9 after reaching the six-figure milestone for the first time on Dec. 5.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $96,270 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHartmann claimed that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, predominantly driven by “short squeezes.”\n\nIf Bitcoin rises by 2.41%, above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquidity building up on the topside for Bitcoin,” CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover said in a Dec. 10 X post.\n\n“We all know what’s next,” he added.\n\nIf Bitcoin surpasses $99,000, around $1.53 billion in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Source: CoinGlass\n\n“Each rally and dump seems to move us closer to return dispersion in the space,” Hartmann said.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said in a Dec. 10 X post that Bitcoin “generally moves 30-50% after breaking a long consolidation within this cycle.”\n\nRelated: Different this time: 'Altcoin season' no longer driven by Bitcoin rotation — Analyst\n\n“If last year was anything like we can expect this time, the next consolidation period should be shorter, followed by a new leg higher in Q1,” Daan Crypto Trades said.\n\nMeanwhile, Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung recently said that traders have shifted to a “short-term” trading mentality during this cycle.\n\nCrypto analysis firm Santiment said that if retail traders “react with fear” and offload their crypto too quickly, it could trigger an aggressive recovery.\n\nMagazine: ‘Normie degens’ go all in on sports fan crypto tokens for the rewards\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",
    "summary": "Cryptocurrency analysts predict a continued downtrend for most altcoins until January 2025, but are watching for Bitcoin's potential retest of $99,000 driven by short squeezes. If successful, this could lead to an aggressive recovery and higher prices in Q1."

As of Dec. 9, it held 40,435 Bitcoin, worth $3.92 billion at its current price of around $97,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner also reported that it had doubled its energized hashrate in 2024 to reach its end-of-year target of 50 EH/s — making it the first public Bitcoin miner to cross the milestone.\n\n“Mission accomplished … but why stop here,” MARA CEO Fred Thiel wrote on X. “we have more miners on the shelf and we will just keep on adding using our existing capacity.”\n\nMARA (MARA) shares closed down 4.4% to $22.81 on Dec. 10 and saw only a slight 0.5% gain at the end of after-hours trading, Google Finance data shows. MARA is down 0.55% this year after it was one of the industry’s best performers in the 2023 market rebound, rising 586% over last year.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, according to Ripples Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse said Ripple would “soon” announce exchange listings for the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD was announced in April as a product intended to compete with popular dollar-pegged stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nRLUSD entered its testing phase on the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as one of the most popular use cases for cryptocurrency.

He also notes that the current market is smarter and more fragmented, making it essential for investors to understand tokenomics and not make blind investments. Additionally, gaming commentators and coaches highlight the growing importance of narratives, expertise, and community in Web3 gaming."

The gamers actually have coaches — just like a sports team or your wellness-obsessed mate.\n\nAt the YGG Play Summit, Web3 gaming coach Muka describes the job as a “glorified project manager.”\n\n“Being a coach doesn’t mean you come up with all the ideas,” says the former top 200 World of Warcraft player.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to have a strict training schedule like, say, for the Manchester United Football Club players.\n\n“It’s not a very formalized structure,” he laughs, explaining that it’s more of an organic process when they train together on the aforementioned sci-fi card game Parallel.\n\n“There’s times where we’re kind of chilling out and stuff; there’s no need to hit the gas, but when we hit the gas, you know, it’s Discord calls going for hours a day, people running in and out, running scrims, playing a bunch of games, talking ideas.”\n\nHe calls it “trial by fire” and says when players have a new idea, he’d rather they just jump into the game and try it out instead of overthinking it.\n\nAustralia’s world-leading crypto laws are at the crossroads: The inside story\n\nCrazy outcomes when current laws applied to NFTs and the metaverse\n\n“The players are there; they all have their ideas and are experts in what they want to do.”\n\n“It’s all about taking the ideas from a culmination of players and helping them morph those ideas together, creating lineup strategies, letting the expertise of one transfer to the others,” he explains.\n\nMuka says that is where “the magic happens.”\n\n“That feeling of playing with other people and coming up with a strategy and trying to pull it off, that’s always been the most fun for me,” he says.\n\nAs for how many hours gaming coaches spend a week training their players before tournaments, Muka’s not exactly keen to face that reality.\n\n“I can’t quantify in hours; it would hurt me if I told you,” he laughs.\n\n— The third-person battle royale shooting game Off The Grid early access has launched on XBOX Series X|S in Game Preview.\n\n— Blockchain-based gaming metaverse Axie Infinity has launched the Axie Adoption Center; users without an Axie can now receive delegated Axies.\n\n— Gaming giant Immutable has introduced “Perpetual Rewards,” a system that claims to ensure players are rewarded more regularly as opposed to the odd distribution.\n\nDecentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century\n\n“An NFT of a diploma in your crypto wallet, for instance, would turn into a permanent academic certification.”\n\nSEC seeks appeal over Ripple, crypto prices plunge and EU debuts Bitcoin ETF: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 13-19\n\nSEC files motion for appeal on Ripple’s case, Bitcoin and Ether prices plunge and Europe welcomes first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHow to pick a crypto gaming token winner this bull run: Web3 Gamer\n\nBTC hits $100K, Trump taps Paul Atkins for SEC chair, and more: Hodler’s  Digest, Dec. 1 – 7\n\n‘China’s MicroStrategy’ Meitu sells all its Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asia Express\n\n‘Crypto games will soon hit 1M monthly users’: YGG’s Gabby Dizon, X Hall of Flame",
    "summary": "Key points for cryptocurrency markets include the rise of gaming tokens tied to entire ecosystems over individual games, as well as growing interest in narratives and AI memecoins. Experts like Serge-Raymond Nzabandora and Alliestrasza suggest that investing in these ecosystem players can be a smarter bet, while also warning against blindly picking tokens without understanding their underlying tokenomics. Additionally, gaming coaches and experts like Muka highlight the importance of teamwork, strategy, and player expertise in competitive gaming."

    "fullContent": "Diminishing user activity and stiff upward resistance are driving Cardano’s prices lower today with bears focused on ADA price at $0.80.\n\nCardano (ADA) is showing weakness today, trading at $1.022, down 9% over the last 24 hours. An attempted fraud, reduced network user interaction and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could slip lower soon.\n\nADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Cardano has turned negative for the first time in over a month amid rising concerns about its ability to sustain the uptrend.\n\nAgainst a background of this diminishing optimism, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was hacked on Dec. 8.\n\nThe hacker promoted a fraudulent ADA-related token on Solana and posted false claims about a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the ADA and the company behind it that would result in ADA transactions stopping.\n\nAlthough the message looked convincing, the Cardano Foundation denied it immediately, deleted the posts and reassured the community that withdrawals for ADA would continue as normal.\n\nDespite the swift move by the Cardano Foundation to abate the hacker’s plans to defraud its followers, the incident had a direct impact on ADA’s market sentiment, as per data from Santiment.\n\nCardano Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment\n\nThis also affected user interaction with the network, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano since the hacker’s posts appeared on X, as per data from DefiLlama.\n\nThe chart below shows that Cardano’s TVL has fallen by over 21% from an all-time high of $708.92 million on Dec. 3 to approximately $508 million at the time of publication.\n\nTVL on Cardano.
